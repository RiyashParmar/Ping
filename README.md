A Chat-Network.

These is a chat application made in flutter. With Node Js server apis and Mongo-DB as the database. It contains all the nesscary code to run it you may have to change the API URl in main.dart file on top. And you have to Flutter, Node.js, MongoDB installed and configured. Feel free to fork the app and use it modify and submit pull-requests and reviews.

Currently it is very much all pilled together not much sepration of UI, API calls, etc etc. And isnt very much documented but i have given very good names to files and folder which will help you understand what does what and the code of which component can be found where.

You can raise issues if you have any doubts or queries.

Happy fluttering!
